# MERN Stack based Hospital Management System

The project aimed at providing an user interface to the patients wherein the patient can book an appointment just with a click. It also aims to increase the security of the system by using password hashing. It also aimed to improve the efficiency of the hospital resources since the hospital staff and doctors had insights about the number and type of patients beforehand with them.

The website took use of React.js as the frontend library wherein mongoose model was used to store data in MongoDB. Node.js and Express.js were used for web server and routing purposes.

The website provided three modules to the user, admin module, patient module and doctor module. Patient module helped the user to see the availability of the doctors and book an appointment of the same accordingly. It also allowed users to delete the appointment if needed. The doctor module showed doctors their respective dashboards wherein they can see the number of appointments allotted to them. The admin module helped the admin to perform CRUD operations on overall website data as per the need. The website took use of JWT auth token and password hashing for increased reliability and security of the user.
